    "## 1716. Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank\n",
    "\n",
    "Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "He starts by putting in $1 on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in $1 more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in $1 more than the previous Monday.\n",
    "Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.\n",

    "Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: n = 4\n",
    "Output: 10\n",
    "Explanation: After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.\n",

    "Example 2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: n = 10\n",

    "Explanation: After the 10th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2nd Monday, Hercy only puts in $2.\n",
