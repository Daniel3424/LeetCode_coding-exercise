    "## 476. Number Complement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a positive integer num, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: num = 5\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: num = 1\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "The given integer num is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.\n",
    "num >= 1\n",
    "You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.\n",
