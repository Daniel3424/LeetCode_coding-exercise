    "## 492. Construct the Rectangle\n",
    "\n",
    "A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.\n",
    "The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.\n",
    "The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.\n",
    "Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web page you designed in sequence.\n",

    "Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: area = 4\n",
    "Output: [2,2]\n",
    "Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. \n",
    "But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.\n",

    "Example 2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: area = 37\n",
